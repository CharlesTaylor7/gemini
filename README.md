## What is Gemini?
Gemini is a web app simulation of a puzzle I own. Unlike the Rubik's cube which has numerous guides & tools for understanding, I was hard pressed to find information on this puzzle that I was gifted. 

I received the puzzle from my Brazilian inlaws, and the only information I could find on this puzzle initially was from a website entirely in portugese. 

Later I learned about and realized this puzzle is the same as the "Hungarian rings" puzzle but with an extra disk. The solution techniques for the puzzle is the same even with the extra ring.

Still even after knowing the puzzle's true origin, I found the existing tutorials for the puzzle overcomplicate things and make for very slow solves. So I embarked to document and optimize my algorithm. 

## Puzzle description
